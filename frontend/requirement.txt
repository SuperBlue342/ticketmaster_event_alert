when artist add additional shows to their ticketmaster event page i would like to get alerted instantly
recently, I received this project from client.
for example this artist kept adding shows and the only way to figure it out was to just keep refreshing and looking through

yesterday he kept adding additional shows
and it was a pain to try to figure out which ones were new
i was looking for something to alert my instantly once a new show is added to an artist page on TM
in theory i could have it scan a tm event page and when a new event is added i would get an alert.
